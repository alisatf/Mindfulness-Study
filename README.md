# Mindfulness-Study
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop and test software that will help facilitate and augment the neurological and physiological benefits of meditation. To accomplish this, the team will:
- Identify key factors which can be used to identify a meditative state, and quantify the physiological and neurological identifiers and benefits of such a state
- Identify the numerous barriers/stages meditators must navigate in order to enter into a meditative state
- Design software which helps facilitate an easier and faster transition into a meditative state, measured through the factors identified above
- Determine whether software system was effective in facilitating an easier or faster transition into a meditative state, and/or whether such a transition has enhanced the physiological and neurological outcomes for the user
- Assemble and publish the results
-

## Work Plan
1) Conduct literature review, identify previous research on the neuroscience and physiology of meditation. Identify measurable physiological and neurological indicators of a meditative state, measurable indicators of the benefits of meditation, and any transitional stages leading from a 'normal'/resting state into a meditative state. (in progress)

2) Assemble a list of factors which 'define' a meditative state; select a handful which will be measured throughout the course of this study.

3) Identify hurdles in reaching a meditative state, and design a system to help bypass these barriers.

4a) Design study methodology

4b) Build codebase

5) Recruit study group

6) Conduct study

7) Write paper

## Preliminary Definitions: Meditation
A state defined by greater relaxation, drop in stress, heightened concentration/focus and situational awareness, a "happy feeling", and less diverse brain activity (concentration of alpha and omega wave behaviour). Increased focus on the self -- breath-counting, greater 'self-consciousness', and a sense of 'being in the moment'. A state of augmented awareness, a 'settled mind'. Post-meditative benefits in terms of greater focus and performance on concentration tasks.
